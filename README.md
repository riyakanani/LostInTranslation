##My contributions:
all codes besides lines 325-395 in the SpeachToTranslation.py is written by me. Furthermore, I used electrical engineering to rewire the rotary phone in which the input and output of the scripts are fed through. 

##About the project:
"Lost in Translation" is a physical art installation where human participants will enter a "phonebooth" and try to help out a "bot" lost and in trouble on the other line. This is a play on the frustrating human experience of trying to receive help from corporate AI phone systems, where our exhibition now flips the roles between robot and human. We hope to relay the confusion that miscounnication can bring, particularly in the space of technology, but also relating to the experiences of immigrants from foreign countries. By utilizing speech recognition, language translation, and the words from previous participants, each experience is unique and different from the last.

This GitHub repo houses Python script which takes in audio and exports a translated, distorted version. This user's audio input also determines the bots's storyline and responses. This script is intended to be played through a rotary phone which our team rewired. Additionally, the original installation has a map that the user must follow to complete the tasks.
